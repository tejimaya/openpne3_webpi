How to Update OpenPNE3.3
========================

Getting Started
---------------

This document is for updating OpenPNE 3.2.0 + to OpenPNE 3.3.x.

You should backup database before your updating.

Plan
----

The updating plan is the following:

(1) Setting files
(2) Update the configuration file
(3) Execute the updating command

The Way to Work
---------------

Setting Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set the OpenPNE 3.3 files to your web server.

You must change the files from the old to avoid troubles by mixing the new with the old.

Update the configuration file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Copy config/ProjectConfiguration.class.php.sample to config/ProjectConfiguration.class.php.

If you write your original configuration to your old config/ProjectConfiguration.class.php, you should change the new file.

And copy the old config/database.yml to new config/database.yml.

Copy the Plugin Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Copy the contents in old plugins.

::

  $ cp -aur /path/to/old/OpenPNE3/plugins/* /path/to/new/OpenPNE3/plugins
  $ cp -aur /path/to/old/OpenPNE3/plugins/.* /path/to/new/OpenPNE3/plugins

Re-build Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Execute the following command in the project root directory.

::

  $ ./symfony doctrine:build-model
  $ ./symfony cc

Execute the Updating Command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Execute the following command in the project root directory.

::

  $ ./symfony openpne:migrate
  $ ./symfony plugin:publish-assets


This command will update OpenPNE and plugins to newer version.

Now, updating has been done.
